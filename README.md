# üèó CSSE - Procurement Management System For Construction Industry

This is my individual part of the Case Study implementation of the 3rd Year 2nd Semester - Case Studies in Software Engineering (CSSE) module. Here we try to solve the difficulties faced in the procurement procedures in the construction industry. As a solution we have created a Web application and a mobile application, whereas this is a the `Mobile Application`, implemented with React-Native, NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.

**Here I have implemented the part:** 
Once a Site Manager add a purchase order, it should be sent for Procurement Department for approval. Once it's approved they make a quotation and send it to the Supplier. Supplier can view those quotations, make a invoice and send back it to Procurement Department. Those invoices view and find the best one by Procurement Department and change the status accordingly. If the status is approved the Supplier can add delivery details. Those details can be viewed by Site Manager and then he/she can make a relevent payment.

### My Contribution:
* Login to the app as a `Site Manager` or `Supplier`
* Register to the app as a `Site Manager` or `Supplier`
* Create an Order by Site Manager 
* View all created Orders by Site Manager
* View delivery details 
* Make a payment by looking the delivery details
* View quotations by Supplier which send by procurement department
* Create invoices for quotations
* View created invoices
* Add delivery details

<!-- ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it. -->
